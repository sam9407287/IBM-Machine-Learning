# Parametric vs. Non-Parametric Modeling

## 1. **Parametric Modeling**
   - **Definition**: Assumes data follows a specific distribution described by a finite set of parameters.
   - **Examples**: Linear regression, logistic regression, Gaussian mixture models.
   - **Advantages**:
     - **Interpretability**: Clear mathematical form, easy to understand.
     - **Computational Efficiency**: Faster training and prediction due to fewer parameters.
     - **Low Data Requirements**: Suitable for small datasets.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - **Strong Assumptions**: Performance suffers if assumptions are incorrect.
     - **Low Flexibility**: Struggles with complex, nonlinear relationships.

## 2. **Non-Parametric Modeling**
   - **Definition**: No strong assumptions about data distribution; model complexity grows with data size.
   - **Advantages**:
     - **High Flexibility**: Captures complex, nonlinear patterns.
     - **Adaptability**: Works well with diverse data types.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - **Low Interpretability**: Harder to explain due to lack of clear mathematical form.
     - **Computational Inefficiency**: Slower training and prediction for large datasets.
     - **High Data Requirements**: Requires large datasets for effective performance.

## 3. **Choosing Between Parametric and Non-Parametric Models**
   - **Data Size**: Parametric for small datasets; non-parametric for large datasets.
   - **Problem Complexity**: Parametric for simple problems; non-parametric for complex problems.
   - **Interpretability Needs**: Parametric if interpretability is critical; non-parametric if prediction accuracy is prioritized.

## 4. **Combining Both Approaches**
   - Use parametric models for initial analysis and non-parametric models for detailed modeling.
   - Incorporate parametric components into non-parametric models to improve interpretability and efficiency.
