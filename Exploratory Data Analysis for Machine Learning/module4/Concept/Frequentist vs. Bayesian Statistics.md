# Frequentist vs. Bayesian Statistics

Frequentist and Bayesian statistics are two fundamental approaches to statistical inference. They differ in their interpretation of probability, treatment of parameters, and methodology. Below is a comparison of the two approaches.

## 1. **Philosophical Foundations**
   - **Frequentist**:
     - Probability is interpreted as the long-run frequency of events.
     - Parameters are fixed, unknown quantities.
     - Data is random and sampled from a population.
   - **Bayesian**:
     - Probability is interpreted as a degree of belief or uncertainty.
     - Parameters are random variables with associated probability distributions.
     - Data is fixed, and parameters are updated based on observed data.

## 2. **Treatment of Parameters**
   - **Frequentist**:
     - Parameters are fixed and unknown.
     - Inference is based on the likelihood of the data given the parameters.
     - Example: Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).
   - **Bayesian**:
     - Parameters are random variables with prior distributions.
     - Inference is based on the posterior distribution of the parameters given the data.
     - Example: Bayes' Theorem.

## 3. **Inference Methods**
   - **Frequentist**:
     - Hypothesis testing (e.g., p-values, confidence intervals).
     - Focus on the sampling distribution of estimators.
     - Example: Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST).
   - **Bayesian**:
     - Posterior probability distributions.
     - Credible intervals (e.g., 95% credible interval).
     - Example: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for posterior sampling.

## 4. **Use of Prior Information**
   - **Frequentist**:
     - Does not incorporate prior information.
     - Relies solely on the observed data.
   - **Bayesian**:
     - Incorporates prior information through the prior distribution.
     - Updates prior beliefs with observed data to form the posterior distribution.

## 5. **Advantages**
   - **Frequentist**:
     - Objective: No need to specify prior distributions.
     - Computationally simpler for many problems.
     - Well-suited for large sample sizes.
   - **Bayesian**:
     - Flexible: Incorporates prior knowledge and updates beliefs.
     - Provides a natural framework for uncertainty quantification.
     - Well-suited for small sample sizes and hierarchical models.

## 6. **Disadvantages**
   - **Frequentist**:
     - Limited ability to incorporate prior information.
     - Interpretation of confidence intervals can be unintuitive.
     - Relies on asymptotic approximations for small samples.
   - **Bayesian**:
     - Requires specification of prior distributions, which can be subjective.
     - Computationally intensive for complex models.
     - Results can be sensitive to the choice of prior.

## 7. **When to Use**
   - **Frequentist**:
     - When prior information is unavailable or irrelevant.
     - For hypothesis testing and large-sample inference.
     - When computational simplicity is important.
   - **Bayesian**:
     - When prior information is available and relevant.
     - For small-sample inference and hierarchical modeling.
     - When a full probabilistic framework is desired.

## 8. **Example Comparison**
   - **Frequentist**:
     - Estimate a population mean using the sample mean and a confidence interval.
     - Test whether a coin is fair using a p-value.
   - **Bayesian**:
     - Estimate a population mean using a posterior distribution derived from a prior and the data.
     - Update the probability that a coin is fair using observed data and a prior belief.
