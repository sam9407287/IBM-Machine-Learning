# Type I Error and Type II Error in Hypothesis Testing

In statistical hypothesis testing, **Type I error** and **Type II error** are two primary types of errors that correspond to different kinds of mistakes in decision-making.

### Type I Error (False Positive)
- **Definition**: Rejecting the null hypothesis (H₀) when it is actually true.
- **Explanation**: This means you incorrectly conclude that there is a significant effect or difference when, in reality, there is none.
- **Symbol**: α (significance level), commonly set at 0.05.
- **Example**: Concluding that a drug is effective when it actually is not.

### Type II Error (False Negative)
- **Definition**: Failing to reject the null hypothesis (H₀) when it is actually false.
- **Explanation**: This means you fail to detect a true effect or difference that exists.
- **Symbol**: β, where the power of the test is 1 - β.
- **Example**: Failing to conclude that a drug is effective when it actually is.

### Summary
- **Type I Error**: Incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis.
- **Type II Error**: Failing to reject a false null hypothesis.

These two types of errors need to be balanced in statistical testing, typically by setting the significance level and the power of the test.
