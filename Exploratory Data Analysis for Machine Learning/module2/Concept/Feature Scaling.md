# Normalization vs. Standardization

Normalization and standardization are two common techniques used to scale and transform data. Both methods are essential for preparing data for machine learning models, especially when features have different scales. Here's a detailed discussion on both techniques:

## Normalization

### Definition
Normalization typically refers to scaling data to a specific range, usually [0, 1]. It is also known as **Min-Max Scaling**.

### Formula
\[
X_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{X - X_{\text{min}}}{X_{\text{max}} - X_{\text{min}}}
\]

### Use Cases
- **When to Use**:
  - When the data distribution does not follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution.
  - When the algorithm requires data to be within a specific range (e.g., neural networks, k-Nearest Neighbors).
- **Examples**:
  - Image processing (pixel values are scaled to [0, 1]).
  - Algorithms that use distance measures (e.g., k-NN, clustering).

### Advantages
- Preserves the original distribution of the data.
- Ensures that all features are on the same scale, which can improve the performance of certain algorithms.

### Disadvantages
- Sensitive to outliers, as the min and max values can be heavily influenced by extreme values.
- Not suitable for data with significant outliers.

## Standardization

### Definition
Standardization scales data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It is also known as **Z-score normalization**.

### Formula
\[
X_{\text{standardized}} = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\]
where:
- \(\mu\) is the mean of the feature.
- \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation of the feature.

### Use Cases
- **When to Use**:
  - When the data follows a Gaussian distribution.
  - When the algorithm assumes that the data is centered around zero (e.g., Principal Component Analysis, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression).
- **Examples**:
  - Algorithms that assume normally distributed data (e.g., PCA, LDA).
  - Gradient descent-based optimization algorithms.

### Advantages
- Less sensitive to outliers compared to normalization.
- Suitable for algorithms that assume normally distributed data.

### Disadvantages
- Does not bound the data to a specific range, which can be problematic for some algorithms.
- May not preserve the original distribution of the data.

## Key Differences

| **Aspect**          | **Normalization**                          | **Standardization**                     |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Range**            | Scales data to a specific range (e.g., [0, 1]). | Scales data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. |
| **Sensitivity to Outliers** | Highly sensitive to outliers.            | Less sensitive to outliers.             |
| **Use Case**         | Suitable for non-Gaussian distributions.   | Suitable for Gaussian distributions.    |
| **Algorithms**       | k-NN, neural networks, image processing.   | PCA, LDA, linear regression, SVM.       |

## Summary
- **Normalization** is useful when you need to scale data to a specific range and when the data does not follow a Gaussian distribution. However, it is sensitive to outliers.
- **Standardization** is more robust to outliers and is suitable for algorithms that assume normally distributed data. It scales data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Choosing between normalization and standardization depends on the specific requirements of your data and the machine learning algorithm you plan to use. In some cases, you may need to experiment with both techniques to determine which one works best for your application.
