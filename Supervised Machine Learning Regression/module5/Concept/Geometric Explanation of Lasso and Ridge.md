# Geometric Explanation of Lasso and Ridge

The differences between Lasso (L1 regularization) and Ridge (L2 regularization) can be understood geometrically by considering the intersection of the "constraint region" and the "contour lines."

## 1. Geometric View of Lasso (L1 Regularization)
The regularization term for Lasso is:

\[
\lambda \sum |w_i|
\]

The constraint region for Lasso is a **diamond shape (or L1 ball)**, as the L1 norm's level sets form a diamond. This shape means that when the contour lines (representing the least squares error) intersect with the constraint region, they are more likely to intersect at the axes, causing some weights \( w_i \) to become zero. Therefore, Lasso results in "sparse solutions," effectively selecting fewer features.

## 2. Geometric View of Ridge (L2 Regularization)
The regularization term for Ridge is:

\[
\lambda \sum w_i^2
\]

The constraint region for Ridge is a **circular shape (or L2 ball)**, as the L2 norm's level sets form a circle (or high-dimensional sphere). When the contour lines intersect the constraint region, they do not typically touch the axes, meaning Ridge will shrink the weights but not drive them to zero. This makes Ridge more suitable for handling multicollinearity, but it does not perform feature selection.

## 3. Intuitive Comparison

| Characteristic       | Lasso (L1)                          | Ridge (L2)                          |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Constraint Region    | Diamond                              | Circle                              |
| Will weights be zero | May become zero, leading to sparse solutions | Will not become zero, just shrink  |
| Best suited for      | High-dimensional data with fewer important features | All features contribute to prediction |
| Feature Selection    | Performs feature selection          | Does not perform feature selection |
| Suitable for        | Sparse datasets                     | Multicollinearity problems         |

This geometric perspective explains the different behaviors of Lasso and Ridge in practice.
