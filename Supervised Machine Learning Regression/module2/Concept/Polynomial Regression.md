# Polynomial Regression

## Introduction
Polynomial Regression is an extension of Linear Regression that allows modeling of non-linear relationships between the dependent and independent variables. It achieves this by introducing polynomial features, transforming the original input variables into higher-degree terms.

## Concept
In Polynomial Regression, the relationship between the input variable and the output variable is modeled as an \(n\)th-degree polynomial. Although it introduces non-linearity in the model, it is still considered a linear model because the parameters are estimated using linear regression techniques.

## Difference Between Polynomial and Linear Regression
- **Linear Regression** models the relationship between variables using a straight line and is effective when the data follows a linear trend.
- **Polynomial Regression** captures more complex relationships by fitting a curve to the data, making it suitable for datasets with non-linear patterns.

## Advantages
- Can model complex and non-linear relationships.
- More flexible than simple linear regression.
- Provides better fitting if the degree is chosen appropriately.

## Disadvantages
- Higher-degree polynomials can lead to overfitting.
- Requires careful selection of the polynomial degree to balance bias and variance.
- Computationally more expensive than linear regression.

## Applications
- Predicting trends in finance and economics.
- Modeling growth curves in biology and medicine.
- Engineering applications where relationships between variables are non-linear.
- Forecasting in meteorology and climate science.

## Conclusion
Polynomial Regression is a powerful technique for capturing non-linear relationships in data. However, choosing an appropriate polynomial degree is crucial to avoid overfitting while maintaining model generalization. Understanding its advantages and limitations helps in effectively applying it to real-world problems.
